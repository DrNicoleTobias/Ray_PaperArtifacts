This folder contains all PCB hardware module files, Bill of Materials (BOM) associated with each module and the design files to 3D print a prototyping enclosure and cap/cover for the finished sensor PCB.

# PCB_Designs
This folder contains all of the design files for the custom Ray PCB modules (Solar, MCU, and Radio) as well as PDFs of these design files for viewers convenience.  These files were created using the AutoDesk Eagle Software.

# 3D_Enclosure
This folder is for the various 3D housing models that have been created for housing the custom PCB and solar panels for the final Ray Sensor.  

**BOM.xlsx**
This is the Bill of Materials that lists the parts/components used for each of the custom PCB modules (arranged by tabs).
