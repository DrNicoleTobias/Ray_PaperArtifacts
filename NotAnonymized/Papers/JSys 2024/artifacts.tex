%The artifacts associated with this paper are the PCB design and 3D prototype housing files used to create the sensor presented in this work as well as the software for training and implementing the deployed \sysname functionality. 
The artifacts associated with this paper consist of both hardware and software files needed for building a functioning deployment of the Ray sensor.  We are including the custom PCB designs, Bill of Materials, and 3D prototype housing files used to create a Ray sensor. PDFs of the schematic and board design files are also included for reviewer convenience.  Software for training and the firmware that runs the Ray sensor and base station are also provided.  Documentation includes both how to build, set up, tune, train, and deploy a Ray sensor as well as how to set up a base station for receiving the sensor data.  We are also including some sample raw results and a few different video demonstrations of the working sensor/system to assist in reviewer assessment since it could be difficult or not feasible for them to build a sensor for testing purposes in the review timeframe.
