- We NEED to take power readings of our components so that we can figure
  out the power draw of our system and estimate its lifetime. I took some
  over the weekend, and assuming I did it correctly, here are some figures:
    - Solar cells generate ~1.6v up on the door
    - Solar cells generate ~0.3 micro amps

- Solar Cell with 330k resistor produces 700-800mV without blockage at 11am (sunny day). Drops down to ~680mV when someone walks through

- Solar Cell with 1.2M resistor produces 950mV-1V without blockage at 11am (sunny day). Drops down to ~900mV

- Solar Cell with 2M resistor behaves the same as the 1.2M resistor

- 100k resistor gives 400mV per solar cell

- We need to start looking into powering the system. A good starting point
  would be creating a system powered by only 1 main capacitor. (i.e. the
  solar cells will provide energy to the comparator for sensing as well
  as providing energy to the capacitor which will then power the system)
	- A potentional problem with this is that sensing requires that
	  the power supply waver (like when someone blocks the solar cells)
	  but to power the system we want a supply that doesn't waver (which
	  is what will happen if you add a capacitor to the solar cells)
	  So we need to figure out how to completely decouple the power and
	  sensing or at the very least minimize their impacts on each other.	diode?

- Read this paper on UFoP http://josiahhester.com/cv/files/sensys15ufop.pdf

- Bother Josiah about making working UFoP boards because after we figure
  out our 1 capacitor powered system we're going to want to make one
  with several capacitors that power different sub groups of the system.

- Entire system draws as low as 0.3 uA after resting for a few seconds, ~1.0-1.5 mA
  after firing a few times, and as high as ~4.2 mA when constantly firing.

- Dr. Sorber wants to look into making this work without the echo sensor, and an ambient light sensor instead.

- No breakout for the light sensor. (none online either?)
