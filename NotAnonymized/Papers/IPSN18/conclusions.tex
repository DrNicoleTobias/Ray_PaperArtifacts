\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper has presented \sysname, a batteryless, energy harvesting doorjamb mounted sensor system for room level occupancy monitoring.
\sysname uses its energy source---generated from an array of solar cells---as data signal for detecting doorway movement, as well as the energy that powers all activities.
\sysname uses a novel, tunable, detection circuit that watches the energy harvesting signal with the processor asleep, and it is the first batteryless occupancy monitoring system in existence.
We deployed \sysname in a laboratory doorway and found that it can detect single persons moving through the doorway in reasonably lit office / lab settings. Our results show that \sysname can differentiate between entry and exit of persons walking through the doorway with high accuracy. 
We evaluated \sysname microbenchmarks that demonstrate \sysname is low power, and efficient, able to harvest enough energy to power all activities, intermittently, while providing quality of application.
\sysname represents a first step towards robust and reliable occupancy monitoring systems without batteries, using energy harvesting.
