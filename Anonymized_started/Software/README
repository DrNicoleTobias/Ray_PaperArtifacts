NOTES
    - must run python scripts as root in order
      to see and connect to serial ports

    - Naming convention:
	    <board>_<sensors>_<describe test>.csv
	    "ti_solar_doorclosed.csv"
	    "ar_gesture_2walks.csv"

    - Connect to higher ACM# port for the TI board

    - This velcro is fucking STRONG so if you want
      to detach the sensors/microcontrollers use the
      tool located in the "ifixit" box that looks like
      a dull scalpal. You can slide it inbetween the
      velcro pieces until they come undone. Otherwise,
      it is way more likely that the velcro pieces will
      stay together and the sensor/board will come off
      with all of the glue.

INSTALLED PACKAGES and ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    - vim and updated .vimrc
    - updated .bashrc
    - Created a "Scripts" folder in home where we can place
      bash and python scripts for global access
        - In order to run the python scripts without typing
          "python2.x" you must add "#!/usr/bin/python" to the
          first line of your python script.
        - In order to get the python script to run with sudo
          I also had to add the Scripts folder's $PATH to the
          end of the secure_path variable in "sudo visudo".
          This is because sudo actually uses a different path
          than if you were running it as just the user.
        - Because I'm just that lazy, I made a bash script to
          wrap my python script so that I dont have to type
          "sudo". Now, to run "serialToCSV.py" or "serialToTerminal.py"
          simply type:
            serialToCSV SolarCSV/nameOfOutputFile.csv
            serialToCSV MultiCSV/nameOfOutputFile.csv
                OR
            serialToTerminal
          Also, you should be able to tab complete it so you
          dont have to type all of serialToCSV/serialToTerminal
