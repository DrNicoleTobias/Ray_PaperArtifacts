This folder contains all of the various PCB design revisions and documentation over the life of this project.  
-->Note:  Documentation of Waldo hardware revisions only guaranteed complete starting with revision F.

#Waldo Rev. A through #Waldo Rev. C
These folders contain past versions of the Waldo project and do not function as expected.  These are left for archival reasons as the project grows.

#Waldo Rev. D
Status:  Works kind-of.
This folder contained the closest working model of the PCB.  This PCB design, however, works as expected only when a Saleae is connected to the system at all test points as its internal resistance greatly influences the system and impacted resistor values chosen in the schematic.  

#Waldo Rev. E
Status:  Dead-end.
This folder contains an incomplete attempt at improving upon Rev. D.  Progress stalled on this attempt and ended with the graduation of a student.  

#Waldo Rev. F (NT)
Status:  Currently being developed/tested - Under construction.
This folder contains the version of Waldo's PCB design that is currently being developed.  Rather than branching from Rev. E, this was developed by a new student to the project to modify and address concerns that arose from Rev. D.  Rev. F is being developed with the assumption that a Saleae need not be attached for the system to function.  This folder contains all files and complete hardware documentation for the state of Rev. F.
