%The buildings of our science fiction dreams have always adapted to the needs of their occupants.
%Today, "smart buildings" are poised to become reality, enabled by advances in sensors that monitor room-level occupancy and movement.
Room-level occupancy-tracking systems enable intelligent control of building functions like air conditioning and power delivery to adapt to the needs of their occupants.
%This allows buildings to be more capable of adapting to the needs of their occupants in their day-to-day activities and better optimize certain resources, such as power and air conditioning, to do so.
Unfortunately, existing occupancy-tracking systems are bulky, have short battery lifetimes, are not privacy-preserving, or only provide course-grain occupancy information.
Furthermore, retrofitting existing infrastructures with wired sensors is prohibitively expensive. %\hey{ remove "bulky" because Waldo is not tiny in size, and replace these two sentences with "Unfortunately, existing occupancy-tracking systems have short battery lifetimes, are not privacy-preserving, or require retrofitting existing infrastructure with wired sensors, which is prohibitively expensive. -AA}

%In this paper, we present \sysname, a \textit{batteryless}, room-level occupancy monitoring sensor that harvests energy from indoor ambient light reflections, and uses changes in these reflections to detect when people enter and exit a room.
%%This information is then communicated by radio to a basestation for further processing and actuation.
%\sysname is mountable at the top of a doorframe or passageway, allowing for the detection of a person and the direction they are traveling at the entry and exit point of a room or hallway.
%We evaluated the \sysname sensor in an office-style setting under mixed lighting conditions (natural and artificial) on both sides of the doorway, with subjects exhibiting varying physical characteristics such as height, hair color, gait, and clothing.
%We conducted \numExp controlled experiments in \numDoors doorways with \numPeople individuals and achieved a total detection accuracy of \SysAccuracy and movement direction accuracy averaging \dirAccuracy.  
%We also deployed an uncontrolled in-the-wild experiment using \sysname sensors in \ITWdeployedWaldos different locations across more than \ITWdays collectively and compared \sysnames performance to similar a commercial batteryless motion sensor during these deployments.  \sysname outperformed the commercial sensor in all cases, especially in cases where there is moderate to heavy hallway traffic.   
%%Further, it judged the direction of movement correctly with an accuracy of \dirAccuracy.
%%This paper also explores and discusses various practical factors that can impact the performance of the current system in actual deployments.
